        <p>Folk art is kept alive in organizations all over the country. In Switzerland, it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. There are also many regional and local rites demarcating times of the year. Yodeling, despite being stereotypical for Switzerland, is not widespread and is limited to only some mountain areas. The same is true for the accordion, which is sometimes called by the name Schwiizerörgeli, implying that it was a Swiss musical instrument, rather than the German Handorgel.</p>
        <p>Playing a game of Hornussen is one of the biggest traditions in Switzerland. Along with Hornussen, Schwingen is one of the national sporting traditions of Switzerland. Schwingen—which means “to swing” in German—most likely originated in medieval Switzerland; today, it is one of the most treasured Swiss customs. Two men (or, increasingly, women) wearing traditional belted leather shorts enter a sawdust-covered ring and wrestle until one has pinned the other to the ground.</p>
        <p>Zurich’s annual spring festival always goes off with a bang—literally. One of the highlights of this festival, usually in the third Monday in April, is the Böögg, a large snowman figure packed with explosives that is ceremoniously lit on fire. Like many traditions in Switzerland, this festival dates back to medieval times when work after 6 p.m. was illegal (hence the name of the festival, which roughly translates to “the six o’clock ringing of the bells”). The festival now marks the beginning of spring.</p>
